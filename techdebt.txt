initializeTypeHeader in BzoChecker.hs uses nubBy to remove redundant references
to type variables. I don't trust the implementation. It makes some assumptions
with nubBy and the ordering of the list.

The exact details seem to barely check out from my analysis, though I'm not
reasoning about it too deeply at the moment. Just keep an eye on this in cases
of errors with type variables with missing constraints.

tagscopes in BzoChecker.hs omits a position value while calculating scopes. It
ideally should provide a real value, but for now it causes crashes so it is
commented out.
