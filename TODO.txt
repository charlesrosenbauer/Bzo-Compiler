TODO:
  * SymbolTable stuff seems confusing and unintuitive. I think replacing this with
      the Scopetable code might be a good idea.
  * Scope table should feature mapping from TextId -> Object(Def, Var)
  * Work out exactly what "@" means as a namespace, and how that should work with Scopetable functions
  * Reorganize checking code - it's a mess
  * Type Checking
  * Golang Backend
  * Work out how to change namespace management to use NameTable
  * Expression Modelling Code
  * Issues seem to exist with namespaces sharing names with types

----
TODO for Next Iteration of Compiler:
  * BzoPos should feature ranges - from LaCb -> LxCy
  * BzoPos should feature a "derivedFrom" field as (tag, ()) to make debugging easier when dealing with metaprogramming code
