TODO:
  * Reorganize Code to be a bit less scattered
  * Type Checking
    * Change checkTypes to return [Err]; no errors are returned if type checking passes
    * TyHeader checker
    * MakeType & TVar checker
    * TyClass checker
  * Expression -> Interpreter Translator
    * typechecking during process
    * complex expressions
  * Interpreter
    * fn calls
    * constructors
    * tyclass dispatch
    * scopes
    * I/O
  * Work out how to change namespace management to use NameTable
  * Issues seem to exist with namespaces sharing names with types
  * Matching on single-element arrays might pose an issue in the current
      implementation. This will have to get worked out eventually.

TODO for Next Iteration of Compiler:
  * BzoPos should feature ranges - from LaCb -> LxCy
  * BzoPos should feature a "derivedFrom" field as (tag, ()) to make debugging easier when dealing with metaprogramming code
