TODO:
  * Type Checking
  * Golang Backend
  * Work out how to change namespace management to use NameTable
  * Expression Modelling Code
  * Issues seem to exist with namespaces sharing names with types
  * Matching on single-element arrays might pose an issue in the current
      implementation. This will have to get worked out eventually.
  * Add some analysis for detecting recursive/infinite structs

----
TODO for Next Iteration of Compiler:
  * BzoPos should feature ranges - from LaCb -> LxCy
  * BzoPos should feature a "derivedFrom" field as (tag, ()) to make debugging easier when dealing with metaprogramming code
