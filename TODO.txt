TODO:

  * Add scope tracking - scope ids, scope table
  * Scope table should feature mapping from TextId -> Object(Def, Var)
  * Reorganize checking code - it's a mess
  * Type Checking
  * Golang Backend
  * Something seems to be broken in Type overload checks
    * Specifically, it seems to be going on in Namespace management.
  * Work out how to change namespace management to use NameTable
  * Expression Modelling Code

----
TODO for Next Iteration of Compiler:
  * BzoPos should feature ranges - from LaCb -> LxCy
  * BzoPos should feature a "derivedFrom" field as (tag, ()) to make debugging easier when dealing with metaprogramming code
