TODO:
  * Reorganize Code to be a bit less scattered
  * Type Checking
  * Expression -> Interpreter Translator
  * Interpreter
  * Work out how to change namespace management to use NameTable
  * Issues seem to exist with namespaces sharing names with types
  * Matching on single-element arrays might pose an issue in the current
      implementation. This will have to get worked out eventually.

----
TODO for Next Iteration of Compiler:
  * BzoPos should feature ranges - from LaCb -> LxCy
  * BzoPos should feature a "derivedFrom" field as (tag, ()) to make debugging easier when dealing with metaprogramming code
