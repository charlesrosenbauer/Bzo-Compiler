This is a test file for the Literate Bzo parsing mode.
Here, any line that does not start with the '>' character automatically is commented out.
This is great for walking the reader through hard-to-understand code.



Here we initialize the file:

> LiterateTest $Module
> Math         $link


Here we define a function:

> ! :: Integer ;; Integer
> (x) ! :: (x -?. 0. (x. x pred !))?
> (1) ! :: 1
> (0) ! :: 1

The above function is a factorial function. If the input is negative, it returns 0.
If the value is 1 or 0, it returns 1.
For all other values, we calculate the factorial recursively.
It is valid for all Integer types.
